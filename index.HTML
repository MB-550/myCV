        <p>
            As a BSC IT graduate I am looking to secure a Graduate/ Intern position or similar to utilise my acquired analytical skills and knowledge and to further assist in developing these skills in a practical and fast-paced environment.<br> 
            I believe that with the correct guidance and mentorship from such a leading organization,that it would greatly assist in my short and long term career aspirations, as well as allowing me to add value to Oliver Wynmann.<br>
            As a young enthusiastic and goal driven student, I aim to make my way into the corporate realm to utilize my acquired skills and showcase my abilities gained over my tertiary education journey. <br>
            I have taken a strong interest to Data Analytics, and as such, have begun self-study exercises as well plan to obtain a further certification, using the Python, programming language.<br>
            As part of my personal hobbies, I enjoy assisting in the family business, in the building of race cars and mechanical work. <br>
            I am committed to achieve my goals and to add value where an opportunity is afforded to me and will be honoured to represent myself in an interview.<br>
